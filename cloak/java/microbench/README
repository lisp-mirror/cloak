This directory contains a number of cloak-specific microbenchmarks I
find useful.

An attempt is made at having at least one benchmark for every bytecode
instruction, in order to precisely track performance regressions.  This
is particularly important because we depend on the Lisp compiler to
optimize our code in the way we expect it to.

The invoke_* benchmarks were initially derived from the methinvbench
package found at http://waitaki.otago.ac.nz/~bryce/gcj/.
